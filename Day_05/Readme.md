📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡:
🔎 The logic here was using XOR operation over the array when the result of XOR is 0 then incrementing the count variable. Then storing the value of count in a separate array.

🔎When all the count variables are stored in the array just iterate over the frequencies of the separate array and check whether all elements are unique. If yes then return true else false.
