📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡:
✅ 𝐁𝐫𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐞: Simple approach looping through the array and comparing consecutive elements if same then moving on to the next. Else storing the element in the incremented position of checking variable 'k' and returning k.

✅𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐈𝐧 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐚𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦(𝒃𝒆𝒕𝒕𝒆𝒓 𝒂𝒑𝒑𝒓𝒐𝒂𝒄𝒉):We start off by iterating through each element and check if the preceding elements are same or not if it's same than just iterate to the next element, if not than store it at the start of the array, and update the checking variable with that element.
