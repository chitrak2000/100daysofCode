📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡:
This question was 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠, to say the least, it was easy but the trick here was using the 𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐟𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, once sorted all I had to do was 𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐲 to see whether 𝐚𝐝𝐣𝐚𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐥 𝐨𝐫 𝐧𝐨𝐭. If equal then storing that element in the answer vector using the pushback function.
