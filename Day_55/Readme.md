✅The given code defines a class named Solution which contains methods to check if a given string is a palindrome or not.
✅The class Solution has a private method named valid(char ch) which takes a character as input and returns true if the character is an alphabet or a digit, and false otherwise.  
✅The class Solution has another private method named toLowerCase(char ch) which takes a character as input and converts it to lowercase if it is an uppercase alphabet and returns the character itself otherwise.  
✅The class Solution also has a private method named checkPalindrome(string a) which takes a string as input and returns true if the string is a palindrome, and false otherwise.  
✅The checkPalindrome method uses two pointers approach to check if the string is palindrome or not.  
✅The class Solution has a public method named isPalindrome(string s) which takes a string as input and returns true if the string is a palindrome after removing all non-alphanumeric characters and converting all uppercase characters to lowercase, and false otherwise.  
✅The isPalindrome method first removes all non-alphanumeric characters from the input string using the valid method.  
✅The isPalindrome method then converts all uppercase characters to lowercase using the toLowerCase method.  
✅Finally, the isPalindrome method checks if the resulting string is a palindrome using the checkPalindrome method and returns true or false accordingly.  
✅The code uses standard C++ libraries like string, iostream, and vector.
