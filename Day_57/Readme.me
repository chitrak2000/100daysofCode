📌𝐐𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:  Longest Common Prefix
Link:https:https://lnkd.in/dmpqS8AY
📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡:
✅Declare a string variable ans and set it equal to the first string in the input vector strs. This variable will store the longest common prefix found so far.
Get the size of the input vector strs and store it in the variable n.
✅Start a loop from i = 1 to n-1 (excluding the first string since it is already stored in ans).
In each iteration, consider the i-th string in strs for comparison with ans.
✅Declare an integer variable j to keep track of the index while comparing characters.
Start a nested loop, where j starts from 0 and continues until either j reaches the minimum size between ans and the i-th string in strs, or a mismatch is found between the characters at position j in ans and strs[i].
If a mismatch is found, break out of the loop, as we have found the longest common prefix for the current iteration.
✅Resize the ans string to the length of the common prefix found in the previous step (i.e., j).
This operation removes any characters in ans beyond the common prefix.

✅After completing the loop, the ans string will contain the longest common prefix among all the strings in strs.
Return ans as the result.
