📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡:
🔎 Intuition was to find 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐝𝐨 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐮𝐦𝐬[𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭] 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐛𝐞 𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐥 𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 "𝐯𝐚𝐥" 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞. So I initialized a j 𝐯𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐲, 𝐬𝐨 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐮𝐦𝐬[𝐢] != 𝐯𝐚𝐥, I assigned the 𝐧𝐮𝐦𝐬[𝐢] 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐚𝐧 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐣𝒕𝒉 𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐣 𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐥𝐨𝐨𝐩 because its basically the number of elements which were not equal to "val".
